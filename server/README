This simple process binds to a TCP socket and accepts connections
from the Android app.  Once connected, it passes the motions through
a named pipe to Google Earth on the same system.

You'll need to create a named pipe, usually with the `mkfifo` tool,
and make sure this server process has permission to read and write.

To point Google Earth at the pipe, change the line 
"SpaceNavigator/device = /dev/input/spacenavigator" 
in the drivers.ini file to point to the named pipe that you created.
To point the server to the correct pipe, use the -f switch.

Use the "-h" option to see usage.
