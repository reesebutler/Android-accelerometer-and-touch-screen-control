This version of the application collects orientation and touch screen data from an Android device's sensors. Requires Android version 1.5 or higher.

FAQS:

Q: Why doesn't it connect?
A: Make sure you are using the correct IP address and port number of the computer that is running the server. You should also only use a LAN IP (not the WAN).

Q: The touch-screen panning sometimes doesn't work, why?
A: When you try to pan, start the motion on a part of the screen that is not a button. Otherwise no motion information will be sent.

Q: Where can I get the server application?
A: The server is written for linux systems, and you can download it here: https://github.com/reesebutler/Android-accelerometer-and-touch-screen-control/tree/master/server

Q: The server doesn't run, why? 
A: Make sure that the file called "server" is executable. If it still does not work, try recompiling the server application. To do this, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory of the downloaded server files, and type "make server".

Q: It says I'm connected, why isn't Google Earth moving?
A: Try turning the sensitivities up. If that doesn't work, make sure that you configured Google Earth to get its input from the correct pipe (the same pipe you must specify when starting the server).
